## Install CLI
Start by installing direflow-CLI
```console
npm i -g direflow-cli
```

## Create new Direflow Setup
Now, use this command to create a new Direflow Setup
```console
direflow create
```
Now you can choose a name for your setup and a prefered language. Currently both JavaScript and TypeScript is supported.  
A folder will be created at your current location.  
  
Now, cd into your new project and use the following commands
```console
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```
Your Direflow Setup will start running on `localhost:3000` and your browser opens a new window  
<br />
<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <base-component></base-component>
</p>

<br />
<br />

## The Setup
When you create a new Direflow Setup from `direflow-cli`, you will get a basic setup that looks like this:  
(TypeScript will have a couple of additional files)  

```
.
├── public
│   ├── index.css
│   └── index.html
├── src
│   ├── direflow-components
│   │   └── my-component
│   │       ├── test
│   │       │   └── App.test.js
│   │       ├── App.css
│   │       ├── App.js
│   │       └── index.js
│   ├── component-exports.js
│   └── index.js
├── direflow-webpack.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

The setup will look close to the one you get when using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
However, there are a couple of differences. 

### index.html
The public folder contains an `index.html` file.  
This is where you consume your Web Component during development.  

### index.js
There will exists two types of essential `index.js` files.  

#### Direflow Component index.js file
There is an `index.js` file that belongs to each Direflow Component.  
All Direflow Components must each be placed in a folder directly inside the folder `direflow-components`.  

> ℹ️ You can change the path to the folder `direflow-components` in the `direflow-config.json` file.  
> See how to do that [here](/configuration).

In this `index.js` file, the React App is mounted as a Web Component using the `DireflowComponent` instance.  
```javascript
// src/direflow-components/cool-component/index.js
import { DireflowComponent } from 'direflow-component';
import App from './App';

export default DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
  },
});
```

In this file you can configure your Web Component.  
As a default, the Web Component will be given the same name as your Direflow Setup, but you can easily rename it with the `tagname` property.
  
The configuration object can also contain _plugins_.  
See more under [plugins](/plugins).
  
#### Main index.js file
There is also a __main__ `index.js` file that is places in `src/index.js`.  
This is the entry file of the setup, and is required to exist.  
In this `index.js` file, it is practical to add any additional functionality or meta-logic for the setup, if needed.  
For instance, this is a good place to hook into your Web Component one it's mounted on the DOM.

```javascript
// src/index.js
import CoolComponent from "./cool-component";

CoolComponent.then((element) => {
   // Access DOM node when it's mounted
  console.log('cool-component is mounted on the DOM', element);
});
```

### component-exports.js
This file is meant to build a regular React component library out of our setup.  
If we need to export our Direflow Components as regular React components rather than building them as Web Components, we can use `component-exports.js`.

We export all components we need in our React component library here:
```javascript
import CoolComponent from './direflow-components/cool-component/App';
import AwesomeComponent from './direflow-components/awesome-component/App';

export {
  CoolComponent,
  AwesomeComponent,
}
```

In this way, we can maintain both a React component library to consume in another React application, and a Web Component library to consume anywhere else.  
All based on the same "source of truth".

### direflow-webpack.js
This file gives you complete control over the Webpack setup.  
A Direflow Setup is using the same configuration as in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but is partially overriden using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).
  
However, this file offers the ability to further override any of the Webpack config that ships with Direflow.  
Simply add an override after the first line:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env),
  // Add your own webpack config here (optional)
});
```

## Access the DOM element
Sometimes we want to access our Web Component whenever it is mounted on the DOM.  
The `create()` method returns a promise with a reference to the DOM element, when resolved.
```javascript
DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
  },
}).then((compnent) => {
    // Do something with the component once it's mounted on the DOM.
  });
```
> ℹ️ Note that DireflowComponent.create actually returns a `DireflowPromiseAlike` which wraps a Promise.  
> This allows the `then` method to be called multiple times.  
> It also means that there's no `catch` method, and that 'async/await' cannot be used.

## Developing
During development of your Direflow Components, you can start the component on development server by running
```console
npm start
```

## Build
Build your Direflow Components by running the command
```console
npm run build
```
This will create a `/build` folder containing a `direflowBundle.js` file.  

In order to use your Web Component, simply import this file in a project, and use your Web Component as:
```html
<script src="./direflowBundle.js"></script>

<awesome-component></awesome-component>
```

## Build React component library
Build your React component library by running the command
```console
npm run build:lib
```
This will create a `/lib` folder containing the React component library.

Add a field to package.json:
```json
"main": "lib/component-exports.js"
```

Now you can publish the React component library using:
```console
npm publish
```

> You may experience a well-known issue with React hooks and multiple instances of React.  
  If you're using hooks in your React components, you want to move `react` and `react-dom` dependencies to `"peerDependencies"` in package.json:
  ```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "16.13.1"
  }
  ```
