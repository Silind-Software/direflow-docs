## Static files

A Web Component is a self-contained native component that runs within a shadowed scope in the DOM.  
For the same reason, it is rather incovenient to bundle static files with the Web Component itself.  
In order to use images or graphic, there are two options:

- **Serve the images, and reference it in a url**: `<img src="https://some-cloud/some-image.png" />`
- **Use SVG**: You can import SVG-files into the component. React will render these as SVG Elements inside the React App instead of loading them at runtime.

## Serve

For development, you can serve the bundle file.  
Simply start the dev-server by using

```console
npm start
```

The bundle will be served on: `http://localhost:3000/direflowBundle.js`

## Shadow DOM

The Web Component will run inside a shadow DOM.  
However, sometimes that's not really what we want.

In order to disable the shadow-root entirely, simply set the `useShadow` property to `false` in the configuration.

```javascript
// src/cool-component/index.js
DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
    useShadow: false,
  },
});
```

## Anonymous Slot
The Web Component Standard supports slot.
In order to enable the anonymous slot, set the useAnonymousSlot property to `true` in the configuration. 
So you can distribute your content(text or embed component) to a <slot></slot> tag.


```javascript
// src/cool-component/index.js
DireflowComponent.create({
  component: App,
  configuration: {
    tagname: 'cool-component',
    useShadow: true,
    useAnonymousSlot: true,
  },
});
```
```html
<cool-component>
  <div>I will be distributed to cool-component's inner slot tag.</div>
</cool-component>
```


## IE 11 Support

In order to support IE 11, you will need to import the necessary polyfills.

Start by installing

```console
npm install abortcontroller-polyfill proxy-polyfill
```

Now add the polyfills to `direflow-webpack.js`:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { webpackConfig } = require('direflow-scripts');

// IE 11 polyfills
function configWithIE11(config) {
  config.entry = [
    path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/abortcontroller-polyfill-only'),
    path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'proxy-polyfill'),
    path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'react-app-polyfill/ie11'),
    path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'react-app-polyfill/stable'),
    ...config.entry
  ];
  return config;
}

/**
 * Webpack configuration for Direflow Component
 * Additional webpack plugins / overrides can be provided here
 */
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...configWithIE11(webpackConfig(config, env)),
  // Add your own webpack config here (optional)
});
```

If you want to use IE 11 during development, add 'IE 11' to `browserlist` under `development` in `package.json`

```json
"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not op_mini all"
  ],
  "development": [
    "last 1 chrome version",
    "last 1 firefox version",
    "last 1 safari version",
    "IE 11" // <- Add this line
  ]
},
```

## Offline support
In order to make the Direflow Components work offline, we need to disable lazyloading of the Web Component polyfills and the React modules.
> ⚠️ Be aware that this will introduce a significantly larger bundle size.

First, we disable lazyloading of `React` and `ReactDOM` dependencies by altering the `direflow-webpack.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = (config, env) => ({
  ...webpackConfig(config, env, {
    react: false,
    reactDOM: false,
  })
});
```

Next, we disable lazyloading of the Web Component polyfills by using the `polyfill-loader` plugins:
```javascript
plugins: [
  {
    name: 'polyfill-loader',
    options: {
      use: {
        sd: false,
        ce: false,
        adapter: false
      }
    }
  }
]
```
Add this plugin to any Direflow Component that needs to function offline.

We now want to install these polyfills as a part of the setup:
```console
npm install @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
```

Then go to your index-file (where you configure the Direflow Components), and **at the very top of the file**, add these imports:
```console
import '@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-bundle.js';
import '@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js';
```
